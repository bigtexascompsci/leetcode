## 3sum
### Description

- Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.
- Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Attempt 1

My first approach for solving the _3Sum_ problem was a brute-force solution that checks every possible combination of three numbers to find those that sum up to zero. By using three nested loops, I calculated the complement of the sum of two numbers and checked if the third number in the array equaled this complement. Although the method is correct, it checks all possible triplets, resulting in an $O(n^3)$ time complexity, which is highly inefficient for larger input sizes. Additionally, this approach does not check for duplicate triplets, leading to potential redundancy in the output. Furthermore, my choice of data structures was not well founded.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {

        ArrayList<List<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int triplet1 = nums[i];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                int triplet2 = nums[j];
                if (i != j) {
                    int complement = 0 - (triplet1 + triplet2);
                    for (int k = j + 1; k < nums.length; k++) {
                        int triplet3 = nums[k];
                        if (triplet3 == complement) {
                            if (i != k && j != k) {
                                List<Integer> temporary = Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]);
                                list.add(temporary);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return list;
    }
}

### Two-Pointer Approach

The key idea is to first sort the array so that the `threeSum` problem can be reduced to a two-pointer problem. After sorting, you iterate through the array and for each element, treat it as the fixed element in the triplet. Then, use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to find the remaining two elements that sum to zero. This approach works because the sorted array allows us to apply the two-pointer technique to find the pair that complements the fixed element. The process ensures that all unique triplets are found without duplicate results.

For each element at index `i`, the left pointer starts just after `i` (at `i + 1`), and the right pointer starts at the end of the array. The sum of the three numbers is computed. If the sum equals zero, a valid triplet is found, and both pointers are moved inward. To avoid duplicates, the loop checks if the next element is the same as the previous one, and skips it if so. If the sum is less than zero, the left pointer is moved inward to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, the right pointer is moved inward to decrease the sum.

            int left = i + 1;
            int right = nums.length - 1;

            while (left < right) {
